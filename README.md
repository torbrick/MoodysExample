# MoodysExample
This is a take home exercise for a job interview with Moodys

I was hoping to make more progress on the local caching and UI testing, but I have run out of time.

I only had time to test on a handful of devices:

Virtual:

"Medium Phone" running Android 15 (this is Android Studios current default virtual device)

Pixel 2 Android 15

Pixel 2 Android 13

Physical:

Pixel 6a Android 14
